# Git


## Overview

`Git` comes with a small range of functions supporting the APL programmer when working on projects with both Cider and Git.


## Philosophy

Experience tells that trying to support all sorts of Git commands from within APL is a recipe for trouble. For exampe, `Checkout` should not be performed from an APL session. 

More complex stuff like `Merge`, `Push` and `Pull` can easily run into a problem without the user doing anything wrong, and when you are then stuck in the middle of something within the call that executed a Git command, well, good luck.

For that reason `Git` offers only a pretty limited number of commands that are useful from within APL while working on a project. For anything else we suggest to use GitBash. `Git` makes this easy because `]OpenGitShell` opens a Git Bash within the current project (if there is just one open) or in the selected or the default project.

As a result most of the commands just provide information about the given project, or an object within that project.

Noticeable exceptions are the methods `Add` and `Commit`. Note that you can execute `Add` implicitly when executing `Commit`; see there.

All functions are also available via an API which lives in `âŽ•SE.Git`. However, the API calls are mor basic. For example, the  `Commit` API function just does that: executing `git commit`. The user command on the other hand first checks whether the project is currently dirty, and if it is it asks the user whether `git add .` should be executed first. 

Also, it opens an edit window for the user to create a message in case the `-m=` option wa not set.

## Methods

```
 Add                Execute the git "Add" commands                                         
 ChangeLog          Takes an APL name and list all commits the object was part of          
 Commit             Performs a commit on the current branch                                
 CurrentBranch      Returns the name of the current branch                                                                      
 GetDefaultProject  Returns namespace and folder of the current default project, if any    
 GoToGitHub         For a project "Foo/Goo" this opens https://github.com/Foo/Goo
 IsDirty            Reports whether there are uncommited changes and/or untracked files
 IsGitProject       Returns "yes" or "no" depending on whether there is a ./.git folder    
 ListBranches       Lists all branches for a Git-managed project                            
 OpenGitShell       Opens a Git shell for a Git managed project                             
 SetDefaultProject  Specifies the project to be used in case no project is specified   
 Status             Reports all untracked files and/or all uncommited changes
 Version            Returns name, version number and version date as a three-element vector
```

## Preconditions and assumptions

* The Git bash must be installed, and available on the Windows environment variable `%PATH%`.
* `Git` assumes that any project is managed by the project manager 
  [Cider](https://github.com/aplteam/Cider).
* `]Git.GoToGitHub` requires you to host your project on GitHub, but all other commands are agnostic in this respect.
